## Project: Building a Student Intervention System

This project was about building a model that would identify students that might need intervention so that they don't fail to graduate. The main focus of the project was to select and tune an appropiate ML algorithm to generate the model. I had the liberty to choose 3 algorithms given that I gave the appropiate reasons to select them. Those algorithms were rapidly tested in order to select and tune the final one.

### View the Project

To view the project open the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/adtabora/Udacity-MachineLearning/blob/master/2.%20student_intervention%20(Supervised%20Learning)/student_intervention.ipynb) 

### Sources

The original uncompleted project can be found on the following git repository:

- [Udacity Repository](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/student_intervention)


### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `student_intervention.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the `student-data.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
